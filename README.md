# Weather-Dashboard

## Description 
This project allowed me to use HTML along with Bootstrap and Javascript with JQuery to create an interface which allows the user to query the weather in a specific city using a weather API. The user types the city name in the text field then selects the 'search' button. The user is then presented with the city, the current date, current temp, humidity, wind speed, and UV Index. There is also a 5 day forecast displayed below the current weather information. All cities searched then get stored into the local storage which also allows the user to be able to click on a previous city searched to display the current weather.

During this project I learned how to call to an API using certain parameters to be able to retrieve and display data to the user. I was also able to expand my knowledge even further with JQuery and how to create class elements and how to use templete literals.
